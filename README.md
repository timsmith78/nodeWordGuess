# nodeWordGuess

This is a word-guessing game like Wheel Of Fortune or hangman.  The player first will be prompted to enter a word or phrase to which the puzzles will be related.  A puzzle is then displayed with all letters hidden.  The player guesses one letter at a time, and if the letter is in the puzzle, it will be displayed.  If the player guesses all the letters in the puzzle before 10 incorrect guesses have been entered, he or she wins!

This game uses the datamuse API to get the acutal puzzles from the topic the player supplies.
